# Hi there, I'm Alex ðŸ‘‹

Enthusiast programmer and modder currently working on plugins, meta services, and dev tooling for a Minecraft community. Started off programming by scripting annoying alerts and flashing text on my humble Piczo page. Quickly moved onto creating a "homepage" of sorts for my secondary school which sneakily had an embedded custom built chatroom to send messages without the teacher knowing. Then onto more elaborate websites and JS games before stumbling onto a Minecraft community and began programming in Java. Graduated from university with a bachelors in Computer Games Programming.
