## Hi there 👋

I've followed Zig in [its decision to move to Codeberg](https://ziglang.org/news/migrating-from-github-to-codeberg/), you can find my profile [here](https://codeberg.org/netherwart?q=&tab=repositories&archived=0&sort=recentupdate). Here are some quick links:

- [CivianMod](https://codeberg.org/netherwart/CivianMod)
- [CivVoxelMap](https://codeberg.org/netherwart/CivVoxelMap)
- [AdventOfCode](https://codeberg.org/netherwart/AdventOfCode)

Anything that remains here on Github is either in the process of being moved, or cannot be moved for other reasons (eg: AzerothCore and Dlang Code not supporting Codeberg).
